        <p>"Liquor" is a broad term that generally refers to distilled alcoholic beverages. Unlike beer and wine, which are fermented, liquor is produced through distillationâ€”a process that involves heating a liquid to create vapor and then cooling that vapor to create a distilled spirit.</p>
        <p>It's important to note that the consumption of liquor should be done responsibly and in moderation. Different types of liquor have distinct flavors and are often enjoyed</p>
